W. Avy and we would like to open surf shop in Oahu, but he wants more information about temperature trends before opening the shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. We conduct the weather temperature analysis using SQLite database and here are some of the results:

##Summary Statistics for June

We extract the temperature data for month of June from sqlite database. At the end of the query we have around 1700 data colection point for month of June and here is the statistic summary table

From this table, the max temp in Oahu in June is 85 F, min temp 64 F and the mean is 75 F. This June temperature statistic is perfect for surf shop , but let take a look at Dec analysis to see if the weather is good for year-round shop bussiness

##Summary Statistics for December

Similiarly extracting data from sqlite database we have around 1570 data collection for December temperature. When looking at this table W.Avy and us are very excited because the the max temp in Oahu in December is 83 F, min temp 56 F and the mean is 71 F which is not significant different from June and support for the idea of the year-round surf and ice cream shop business. You can see the summary table list below :
